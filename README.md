# ManageExternalStorage

1. For Android 11(R) and newer versions, please seek permission for accessing external storage management.
2. For versions of Android below 11(R), please request permission for accessing external storage.

Note: Once the permission is granted, I will input a name and create a folder using that name as an example. Feel free to modify this action as per your requirement.
